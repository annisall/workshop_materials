## Purpose 
This repository is for gathering a code I have used / displayed during talks / workshops. It's then easy to share
the materials to the participants and other people who are interested in getting the materials. 


Disclaimer: usually the workshops have slides in addition to code, and they will not be in the repo. 

## Presentation dates
K-means demo in Turku.py: 23.10.2019
